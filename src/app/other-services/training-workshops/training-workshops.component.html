          I have been conducting trainings for over 10 years. For 5 years, I was an adjunct
          professor at Oakton Community College where I taught a course I developed called
          Sexual Assault Crisis Intervention. Most recently I provided a CEU seminar for the
          Family Services Counseling Center in Aurora.

          social service/mental health, law enforcement, medical professionals, and educators.
          I am adept at tailoring my presentations to fit the needs of the audience.
