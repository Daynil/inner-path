        As couples move towards their wedding day, itâ€™s important they consider the kind of 
        life they envision to live as a married couple. Statistically, couples who have had 
        pre-marital counseling weather the storms of the first year of marriage better than 
        those who have have not received such counseling.  Pre-marital counseling will 
        acquaint the couple with primarily six areas of conflict that most couples face which 
        include money/finance, in-laws, child rearing, sex, roles, and religion/spirituality.

        We believe is important to work with newly committed couples on gaining clarity 
        on important topics in a safe and facilitated environment. We also encourage 
        couples to develop a healthy communication and conflict resolution style, which 
        are key to a successful and healthy marriage. Most clients report that 
        pre-marital counseling is a positive, affirming, and bonding experience that 
        enhances their commitment to marriage.
