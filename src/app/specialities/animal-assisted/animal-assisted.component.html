        Animal Assisted Therapy is one way you can decide to work towards
        healing. Studies show that some of the benefits to those who engage in
        this modality can include: a decrease in anxiety, feeling more safe in
        the counseling environment, an increase in confidence/selfÂ­-esteem, and
        a decrease in psychological stress when dealing with trauma.
