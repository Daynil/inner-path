        I am able to provide individual, couples, and family therapy for those who are 
        lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/transexual, queer/gender variant, questioning, 
        intersex, asexual, and pansexual. As a member of this community, I understand the 
        importance of having a helping professional who respects, supports, and empathizes 
        with you and your journey, as well as understands the complex challenges you may be 
        facing.  I strive to create a safe environment, free from judgement, where you can be 
        yourself and your identity can be supported.
