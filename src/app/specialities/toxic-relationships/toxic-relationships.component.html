        Relationships are never easy. There are many reasons a relationship
        might transition from one status to another. Uncertainty in
        relationships is often confusing and painful, but you don't have to
        remain stuck. Our therapist, <a routerLink="/eryn">Eryn</a>, can help
        you navigate issues related to the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Questioning Whether to Stay in a Relationship</li>
        <li>Toxic or Abusive Relationships</li>
        <li>Breaking-Up/Transitions</li>
        <li>Betrayal/Infidelity</li>
        <li>Divorce</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We can help you find your way through the emotional, psychological, and
        financial maze of contentious relationship transitions or divorce and,
        if applicable, help you develop your "radar" for choosing healthy
        partners in the future.
