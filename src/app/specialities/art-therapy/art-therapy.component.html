        Art therapy is a form of expressive therapy that uses the creative
        process of making art to improve a child’s, teen’s, or adult’s physical,
        mental, and emotional well being. Art Therapy blends the fields of human
        development, visual arts, and the creative process with models of
        counseling and psychotherapy. Self-expression of your true being comes
        forth in your creations. No art experience is necessary; only a
        willingness to bring light to the unknown parts of yourself.
