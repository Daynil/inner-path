        Somatic Resilience and Regulation (SRR) is a form of somatic
        psychotherapy that supports recovery from developmental trauma by
        improving your resilience and self regulation of your own nervous
        systems. SRR theory is based on a combination of attachment theory,
        developmental trauma psychology, somatic psychotherapy, and gentle
        noninvasive touch. It is not massage therapy, but a somatic approach to
        trauma recovery.
