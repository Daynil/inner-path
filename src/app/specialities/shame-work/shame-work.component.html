        Shame is often a source of struggle for many and yet it often remains
        hidden and unchecked. We utilize Dr. Brown's findings about shame
        resilience, vulnerability and courage to assist clients in unlocking
        their potential. We can help you uncover how shame is operating in your
        life. <b>Vulnerability is a strength. Become shame-resilient.</b>
