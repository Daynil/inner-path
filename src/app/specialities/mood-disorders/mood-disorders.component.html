        Changes in moods that interfere with everyday life may indicate a mood
        disorder such as depression or bipolar disorder. Many factors can cause
        mood disorders such as imbalance of brain chemicals, life events, and
        genetics. With appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and support, most
        people struggling with mood disorders do get better and live healthy,
        fulfilling lives.

        Inner Path is lucky to have a therapist who specializes in mood
        disorders. <a routerLink="/asma">Asma</a> helps clients to learn to
        recognize distorted or self- defeating thought patterns, and then
        actively work to replace them with healthier beliefs. She is trained in
        Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Therapy (IPT), and
        she uses these skills in teaching clients how to identify, challenge,
        and re-frame flawed thoughts as well as behavior patterns.
