        I am passionate about my work and I love helping people reconnect with
        themselves. Healing from trauma and grief is not just about surviving
        the experience, it is also about learning to LIVE again. I enjoy being
        part of this process and empowering people to grow, change, heal, and
        thrive!

        I believe it is important to get to the root of the problem, not just
        manage the symptoms. One of the gifts I bring to you is listening deeply
        and helping you feel understood as we collaborate on implementing
        practical solutions.

        I graduated with a Masters in Social Work in 2004 from the University of
        Tennessee Knoxville. I focused on clinical therapy with a specialization
        in sexual assault and abuse survivors. Since then I have worked in
        various settings: inpatient/outpatient mental health, veterinary social
        work, supervising visitation between noncustodial parents and their
        children, substance abuse, Alzheimer’s Association, and rape crisis
        centers. I spent nine years at Northwest Center Against Sexual Assault
        (Northwest CASA) where I was a medical/legal advocate, volunteer
        coordinator, Staff Therapist, Services Manager for the CARE Center
        (Northwest CASA’s McHenry satellite), supervisor for graduate and
        undergraduate interns, professional educator in the community, and grant
        writer. I also coordinated with Oakton Community College to develop and
        teach a class called Sexual Assault Crisis Intervention. While at
        Northwest CASA, I started an Animal Assisted Therapy program with my
        dog, Cassie. To learn more about animal assisted therapy and Cassie
