        When I work with clients, I am helping people take steps towards living
        the life they dream of; I'm doing what I believe in and what I love.

        Psychotherapy can bring insight and powerful transformation to your

        I love being part of the healing process; empowering people with
        knowledge and options about how they can grow and change. I am honored
        to be part of each person's sacred path toward healing.

        With more than nine years experience as a trauma psychotherapist, one of
        the gifts I bring is listening deeply and helping you feel understood
        while helping discover and implement practical solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor (LCPC) I've worked in a
        variety of settings: crisis hotlines, community mental health centers,
        domestic violence shelters, with victims of sexual violence, with
        college students at 4-year university, and in a half-way house for men
        exiting chemical dependency programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I look forward to helping you reconnect with your intuition in a way
        that honors your unique path.
